# HangiFilm? Ionic Source Code

Abstract word game coded with ionic 2.x cross platform technology.

Coded with Typescript 2.x for Ionic 2.x.
300 game items reduced to 10 to just give an example game to you.
Push Notification, In-App Purchase and Options are not implemented.
Fully localized for English and Turkish languages.
Component based programming approach used for all game parts like Preview, LetterDock, LetterSelection, etc.
Gulp system is working well for all supported file types (ts, mp3, png, jpg and css files)

I suggest you to use "Ripple Emulator" (Chrome Extension) to see game in a mobile device on your screen.

Please do not use all graphics material as is, use your customized game graphics.
